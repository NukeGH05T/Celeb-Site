        <p>‚ù§Ô∏è Happy 6 Months, My Love! ‚ù§Ô∏è</p>
        <p>We met on 27th of January.</p>
        <p>It's a fairly long time, even more so considering that neither of us had any idea on what to expect. From ourselves or from each other. No matter what happened we still chose to be together.</p>
        <p>Not just for a day, or a week or a month but, for half a year!</p>
      </div>

      <div class="step fade-in-up">
        <p>üåç Even from Four THOUSAND kilometers away, you‚Äôre the only one closest to my heart.</p>

        <p>All the short snippets you saw were taken from only the first 3 days of our meeting. I want us to go back and reread our messages, at least some of it. To relive the past even though some parts of it were really really terrifying. But, we are still here together love and we will continue to be together.</p>
